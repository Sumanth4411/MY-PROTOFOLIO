            <h3> TRAFFIC RULES AND SIGNS INCLUDING MOCK TEST</h3>
            <p>Traffic rules and signs play a crucial role in maintaining road safety and ensuring smooth traffic flow. A Traffic Rules and Signs Project aims to educate individuals about various traffic regulations, road signs, and safety measures to prevent accidents and ensure responsible driving. This project involves designing an interactive platform where users can learn about different traffic rules, road signs, signals, and the consequences of violations. It includes a detailed explanation of regulatory signs, warning signs, informative signs, and mandatory signs, helping users understand their significance. Additionally, the project may feature quizzes and assessments to test the user’s knowledge and reinforce learning.

                One of the key objectives of the project is to create awareness about speed limits, pedestrian crossings, lane discipline, and traffic signals. The project may include animated simulations of real-world traffic scenarios to demonstrate the importance of following rules like stopping at red lights, giving way to emergency vehicles, and maintaining safe distances. Moreover, it can integrate real-time case studies and accident reports to highlight the impact of reckless driving and non-compliance with road rules.
                
                This project can be particularly useful for students, new drivers, and law enforcement agencies by providing a structured learning experience. A well-designed system can also include a practice test section with 500+ multiple-choice questions (MCQs) to help users prepare for driving license exams. By incorporating an interactive dashboard, users can track their progress, revisit incorrect answers, and improve their understanding of traffic laws.</p>
